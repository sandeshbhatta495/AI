The choice between StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler depends primarily on the data distribution, the presence of outliers, and the requirements of the machine learning algorithm. 
When to use StandardScaler (Standardization)
StandardScaler transforms data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one (unit variance). 
Normally Distributed Data It is the ideal choice if your data features are approximately normally distributed or follow a Gaussian distribution.
Algorithms that Assume Normality Many linear models, such as Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with an RBF kernel, perform better when the data is centered and standardized.
PCA and Clustering Algorithms that calculate variances or distances, like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering, often benefit from standardization so that all features contribute equally.
Maintaining Outlier Influence While outliers do affect the mean and standard deviation, StandardScaler does not bound the values to a specific range, allowing outliers to retain their relative influence on the model, which may be useful in some cases. 
When to use MinMaxScaler (Normalization)
MinMaxScaler rescales data to a fixed range, typically between 0 and 1, by using the minimum and maximum values of the feature. 
Bounded Ranges Use it when you have a known, fixed, or meaningful range for your data from domain knowledge (e.g., image pixel intensities which range from 0 to 255, or percentages).
Neural Networks Many neural networks and deep learning algorithms, especially those using activation functions like sigmoid or tanh, require input values to be within a consistent and bounded range for faster convergence and better performance.
Algorithms Not Assuming Distribution It's a good choice when you don't know the distribution of your data, or when the distribution is not Gaussian.
Sparse Data It is useful for sparse data as it preserves zero values. 
Key Considerations
Outliers MinMaxScaler is highly sensitive to outliers, as extreme values will determine the minimum and maximum for scaling, potentially compressing the majority of the inlier data into a very narrow range. If outliers are present and you cannot remove them, consider using the RobustScaler, which uses the median and interquartile range and is less sensitive to extremes.
Data Leakage Always perform the train-test split before applying any scaler. Fit the scaler only on the training data and then use that same scaler to transform both the training and test sets to prevent data leakage.
Experimentation Often, the best approach is to try both and evaluate which one yields better performance for your specific machine learning model and datase
